# Overlay App

This directory contains modules for an Android overlay application used to display
cheat-related UI elements on top of the Mobile Legends: Bang Bang game. These
modules are placeholders and will be replaced with full Android implementations
in the future.

Files placed here may include Kotlin/Java sources, build scripts, or Python
prototypes that interact with the Android overlay APIs.
