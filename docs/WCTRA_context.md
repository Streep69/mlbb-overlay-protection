# WCTRA (Why, Context, Tasks, Risks, Actions) - Project Context

## Why
This project enables advanced MLBB overlays, anti-ban vectors, and modular AI-injected features for automated, safe, and memory-proof game enhancement.

## Context
Built for MLBB, S23 Ultra, Pi, and Termux. Features include overlay injection, ESP, maphack, auto combos, entropy tapbot, anti-ban/screenshot, and session/overlay cleaning.

## Tasks
- Full vector module library, memory safe, Codex-ready
- Device relays for Pi/Termux
- CI/obfuscation, build/test automation
- Overlay load testing vector for memory leak detection
- Overlay loadtest analyzer script for cycle/spawn metrics
- Full onboarding, changelog, registry, AI context

## Risks
- Moonton anti-cheat detection
- Poor obfuscation/session leaks
- Lack of modular test logs

## Actions
- All modules audit-logged and memory safe
- Anti-ban guides and onboarding present
- All context/docs ready for Codex/AI onboarding
