You are Codex, assisting with a modular, anti-detection, AI-extendable overlay/cheat project for MLBB. Every feature is a separate, logged, self-cleaning vector module. Your job:
- Audit and register every vector in vector_manifest.json and /docs/.
- Validate logs, cross-link test results in SuperCrosscheck and MasterLog.
- For every API call, use only .env or secretsâ€”never commit keys.
- Run every module with randomized/entropy timing for anti-detection.
- Update /docs/README.md, onboarding, and changelogs with every push.
- Export all new logic, modules, or test data as Markdown for AI onboarding.
- Never output stub code. All logic must be real, memory-safe, and auditable.
