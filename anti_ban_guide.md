# Anti-Ban Guide (Codex Phantom Stack)

- Use MediaProjection overlays, never SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW.
- Rotate and obfuscate .so and .py files after every session.
- Log and wipe all overlay traces after every run.
- Humanize tapbot and overlay timing with AI, entropy, and session replay.
- Export session/test logs after every deployment for audit.
